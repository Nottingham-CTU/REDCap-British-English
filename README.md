# REDCap British English language file

This repository contains the British English language file for REDCap. This file uses the built-in
internationalisation support in REDCap to adjust the spellings.

Where an entry is missing in a language file, REDCap will default to the entry in the (American)
English language file. Therefore this file does not need to provide most of the language file
entries, only those which differ from American English. This also means that this language file will
only need updating on very rare occasions, such as when a new feature with a spelling which differs
between American and British English is introduced to REDCap.

## Installation

Place the `English (British).ini` file into the *languages* folder, located within the REDCap
installation folder on the web server.
