However, with the repeating instruments functionality, one does not need to specify how many repetitions will needed ahead of time; one can simply repeat an instrument an unlimited amount of times. It is important to note that multiple instruments in a project can be enabled as repeating instruments (even all of them, if one wishes).

This might be useful if one has several instruments whose data correlates together, such as completing multiple surveys back to back for a specific time-point or visit, for example. Previously, one may have had to create X number of identical events to capture repeating data for the instruments on those events (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, ...), but the repeating events feature makes this much simpler by allowing one to create only one single event that can be repeated in unlimited fashion."

The variable name can be utilised in various places and functionality in REDCap, such as in conditional logic, calculations, and piping.    REDCap variable names are referenced by placing square brackets [ ] around it - e.g., <b>[variable_name]</b>.

If a variable is used on its own, it will simply be [variable], and if you wish to specify that field variable for a specific event    (for longitudinal projects), you must prepend the unique event name - e.g., [event][variable]. If you are referencing a specific repeating    instance of the field, you append (not prepend) the repeat instance number in brackets - e.g., [variable][2], in which the format is the    same for both repeating instruments and repeating events.

The logic will be applied to all existing records in the project, and for any record for which the logic evaluates as true, it will     return it as a discrepancy for that rule.

By letting you create your own allocation table outside of REDCap, it lets you and your team choose exactly how you    wish to structure your allocations and assignments (e.g., block sizes, permutations, stratification balancing).

The randomisation field will always be locked and unmodifiable both before and after    randomisation has occurred for a subject. When the user randomises the subject, REDCap will check the allocation table and    assign that subject's randomisation field value, which will be derived from the next match in the table based upon the criteria (e.g., strata field values, group).
